# Modelling the Variable X-Ray Spectrum of an Accreting Black Hole Binary System.

A Monte-Carlo Radiative Transfer (MCRT) simulation of the spectrum of X-Ray photons 
emitted from a Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).

Photons are subjected to various scattering and absorbtion probabilities 
as they traverse through a circumnuclear gas distribution.
